# Blackjack Game

This is a Python implementation of the popular card game Blackjack. The game allows a user to play against the computer, following the basic rules of Blackjack.

## How to Play

1. The goal of the game is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
2. Both the player and the computer are dealt two cards at the start.
3. The player can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (end their turn).
4. The computer will draw cards until its hand value is at least 17.
5. The game ends when either the player or the computer goes over 21, or both decide to stop drawing cards.

### Card Values

- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth 11 or 1, depending on which value keeps the hand under 21.

### Winning Conditions

- If the player's hand value is 21 with two cards (Blackjack), they win unless the computer also has a Blackjack.
- If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they lose.
- If the computer's hand value exceeds 21, the player wins.
- If neither exceeds 21, the hand with the higher value wins.

## Features

- **Randomized Card Dealing**: Cards are dealt randomly using Python's `random` module.
- **Score Calculation**: Automatically calculates the score for both the player and the computer.
