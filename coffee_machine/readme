## Coffee Machine Program

This is a simple Python-based Coffee Machine program that simulates a coffee vending machine. Users can order different types of coffee, insert coins to make a purchase, and check the available resources.

## Features:

- Allows users to order espresso, latte, or cappuccino.

- Checks if there are enough resources to make the selected coffee.

- Accepts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) as payment.

- Calculates the total amount inserted and processes the transaction.

- Provides change if the user inserts more money than required.

- Displays a report of available resources and earnings.

- Allows the user to turn off the machine.

## How It Works

- The user is prompted to enter a coffee selection (espresso, latte, or cappuccino).

- If the user enters report, the available resources and earnings are displayed.

- If the user enters off, the machine stops running.

- The program checks if there are enough resources to make the selected coffee.

- The user is prompted to insert coins.

- The program calculates the total money inserted and checks if it covers the cost of the coffee.

- If the payment is successful, the coffee is made, and resources are updated.

- If the payment is insufficient, the user gets a refund.
