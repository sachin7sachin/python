# Higher-Lower Game

This is a Python implementation of the Higher-Lower game. The game challenges the player to guess which of two options has a higher number of followers on social media.

## How to Play

1. The game will present two options (A and B) with their name, description, and country.
2. The player must guess which option has more followers by typing `'A'` or `'B'`.
3. If the guess is correct, the player earns a point, and the game continues with a new comparison.
4. If the guess is incorrect, the game ends, and the player's final score is displayed.

## Features
